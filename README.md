# Cell-mpheno
This repo contains data and code used in the MSc project: Genetic identification of the cell types underlying mammalian phenotypes

We used the Tabula Muris, a single cell transcriptomic dataset containing nearly 100,000 cells from 20 mouse organs and the genotype-to-phenotype annotations from Mouse
Genome Database (MGD) to identify the association between cell types and phenotypes using Expression Weighted Celltype Enrichment (EWCE).  

The cross-species phenotypes between MPO and HPO were analysed for supporting translational study.  

Because most phenotypes are the clinical features and symptoms of disease, the connection between mammalian phenotypes and human diseases comes from HMDC and the
connection between human phenotypes and human diseases comes from MONDO database were used to explore the cell type-phenotype-disease association.   

To better maximise the value of these association results, the web-based application (http://www.cell-phenotype.com/) was developed to retrieve and explore the cell type-phenotype associations, cell type-phenotype-disease associations, and the cross-species phenotypes.
